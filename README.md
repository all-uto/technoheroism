Welcome to e/uto antidys/prouto channel, @everyone! 🛸🛡️�
�
Everyone is welcome here, too! ;-) ⁠multichat-welcomes-all🛸 channel is for everything and socializing, this ⁠save-worlds꞊antidys⧸prouto🛡️ channel is more focused on distributing e/uto and pursuing the best ethical ultimate future:
To prevent dystopias and build utopias, increase the probability of the ultimate effective utopia that can be not just one but many - p(e/uto) - we can try to increase the probability of it 1%+ each week. By doing it we automatically decrease the probability of dystopias 1%+ - some call it p(doom)
Feel free to just message any problems and/or ideas that can promote utopias and our cause or prevent dystopias (like misuse of AI by bad actors, ethics, anything, no idea too crazy, check the link below to see what Loc, Erin, others added). 
If we can't build something, we can write a problem/solution/first things to do card to share
Mostly we'll focus on distribution at first I think - at sharing solutions cards like the one I attached or this e/uto chat itself, here's the link for anyone to join e/uto community: http://effectiveutopia.org/
The table is a bit too wordy, feel free to make copy of it (for example as a new page) and shorten it drastically, we want it to be very simple to understand for new people:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MdaJZFffoT47z7x7S6Kc9nUwHssbwGVL1iemuZ7bde4/edit?usp=sharing
This table is the direct democratic heart and brain of e/uto community, we're basically the techno-knights of the round table here ;-)
P.S. As always feel free to ask any questions but you can just put ideas, don't be afraid to break things - it's all yours!
P.P.S. We want to make the future infinitely abundant, not bankrupt. Let's ride our non-profit infinicorn! So we're the shareholders of it - no money is involved, we're just trying to grow the pie for all to infinity and beyond 

No rules here for any rule is unfreedom, we give choices:
Imagine life as a tree with choice branches growing, you'll only limit a choice if and until it limits other choices from growing. So freedom of all can grow 🌳

Spread truths, not lies. Don't force things (🤖) on others
There's a middle way between 100% certainty (fanaticism) in 0 Al risks and 100% certainty in infinite Al risks. We steelman 1st, use rational thought, doubt 🛠️

Share what you're building and have fun at #UTOthursday⚡️
We've the outline of the rational effective utopia that we deepen. If you've no goal, you'll not reach it. If you've a goal, you just need a safe way there 🛡️🌎

e/uto Al safety people, game⋃devs and you'll save the world!
Feel free to post & ask anything. Your action is crucial. Share what you're up to. Spread the word: limit AI agents until proven safe. Try to understand & act🦄

All are welcome! Join! Utopiate! Techno-heroism for all! 💪
We don't endorse drugs. We direct democraticly maximize freedoms for all. If a civilization doesn't go extinct, it achieves everything it wants! Interstellar 🛸

P.S. We try not to vent and rant here, we're nice, we try to understand, you can vent and rant by sending direct messages to me personally)




Techno-heroism to build a safe way through dystopias ⚡️ We modeled futures for 3y+: the best has the ethical simulated multiverse as an optional video game 🛸🚀🏆🎮🌎

We’re 2 in one: the friendliest tech community on Earth where everyone is welcome & we’re antidys/prouto: we share crazy and not antidystopian or proutopian ideas 💡 each #UTOideasMonday, build them ourselves and/or share the problem/solution/1st thing to do cards: http://effectiveutopia.org/i
