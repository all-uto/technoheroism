Welcome to e/uto antidys/prouto channel, @everyone! 🛸🛡️🌎
Everyone is welcome here, too! ;-) ⁠multichat-welcomes-all🛸 channel is for everything and socializing, this ⁠save-worlds꞊antidys⧸prouto🛡️ channel is more focused on distributing e/uto and pursuing the best ethical ultimate future:
To prevent dystopias and build utopias, increase the probability of the ultimate effective utopia that can be not just one but many - p(e/uto) - we can try to increase the probability of it 1%+ each week. By doing it we automatically decrease the probability of dystopias 1%+ - some call it p(doom)
Feel free to just message any problems and/or ideas that can promote utopias and our cause or prevent dystopias (like misuse of AI by bad actors, ethics, anything, no idea too crazy, check the link below to see what Loc, Erin, others added). 
If we can't build something, we can write a problem/solution/first things to do card to share
Mostly we'll focus on distribution at first I think - at sharing solutions cards like the one I attached or this e/uto chat itself, here's the link for anyone to join e/uto community: http://effectiveutopia.org/
The table is a bit too wordy, feel free to make copy of it (for example as a new page) and shorten it drastically, we want it to be very simple to understand for new people:

This table is the direct democratic heart and brain of e/uto community, we're basically the techno-knights of the round table here ;-)
P.S. As always feel free to ask any questions but you can just put ideas, don't be afraid to break things - it's all yours!
P.P.S. We want to make the future infinitely abundant, not bankrupt. Let's ride our non-profit infinicorn! So we're the shareholders of it - no money is involved, we're just trying to grow the pie for all to infinity and beyond
