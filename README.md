## 🛸 Welcome

Welcome to the **ê/uto antidys/prouto** channel!  
Everyone is invited — explorers, builders, dreamers, and techno-heroes alike.

If you’re new, the [⁠multichat-welcomes-all🛸](#) channel is for open socializing, while this **save-worlds꞊antidys⧸prouto🛡️** space focuses on **distributing e/uto** and **pursuing ethical, effective utopias**.

We act to increase the probability of utopias (+1% weekly) while decreasing dystopia risk (−1% p(doom)).  
Every idea counts — whether it’s ethical, creative, technical, or “too crazy to work (yet).”

## 🧩 How to Contribute

💡 **Share ideas:** post anything that can promote utopias or reduce dystopias (AI safety, ethics, governance, creative tech, etc).  
🪪 **Can’t build it yet?** Write a **Problem / Solution / First Steps** card to share.  
🧭 **Focus areas:** we start with *distribution* — sharing solutions, links, and inspiration.

## 🌳 Our Philosophy

> “No rules here, for any rule is unfreedom. We give choices.”

Imagine life as a tree of branching possibilities.  
Limit only the branches that prevent others from growing — so **freedom multiplies**.

- Spread truths, not lies.  
- Don’t force (🤖) your views on others.  
- Balance between certainty and doubt — steelman first, reason always.

## 🚀 Mission

We’re building a **safe path through dystopias**.  
Our best modeled future?  
> *An ethical simulated multiverse — an optional video-game-like reality — where humanity learns, grows, and thrives together.* 🛸🎮🌍  

We’re two in one:
1. 🌱 **The friendliest tech community on Earth.**
2. 🛡️ **antidys/prouto — a space for antidystopian and proutopian builders.**

We share, iterate, and act — all in service of an **infinitely abundant future**.  
Let’s grow the pie for everyone, forever. 🦄♾️
